      Formula One is a premier racing class where drivers compete in open wheel,
      single seat race cars. The sport is sanctioned by the Federation
      Internationale de I'Automobile (FIA) which sponsors a championship series
      called the FIA Formula One World Championship. Each championship series
      awards a title to the top driver as well as one to the top constructor.

      A Formula One season is made up of Grand Prix races hosted at various
      tracks around the world. Currently, ten teams compete in the series with
      each team fielding two drivers. Points are awarded to drivers and
      constructors based on finishing position. Only the top ten finishers are
      awarded points. An additional point can be earned by a top ten finisher
      for having the fastest lap of the race.
